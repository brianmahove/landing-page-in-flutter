# landing-page-in-flutter

This app features an introduction screen that appears only on the first launch. Using shared preferences, it remembers if the user has opened the app before and automatically redirects them to the home page for a smoother experience on subsequent launches.

## Landing Page / Introduction Screen with Shared Preferences

This Flutter app includes an introduction or landing page that provides a welcoming experience for users on their first visit. The introduction screen offers a brief overview of the app's features and helps users get familiar with the interface.

### How it Works:

#### First-Time Users:
Upon the first launch of the app, the introduction screen is shown. This screen typically consists of several slides or a single page that introduces the app's core functionalities and purpose. Users can navigate through the introduction and then proceed to the home page.

#### Subsequent Visits:
For returning users, the app uses the `shared_preferences` package to store a flag indicating whether the user has already seen the introduction screen. Once the flag is set after the first visit, the app will automatically bypass the introduction screen on all future launches and redirect the user directly to the home page for a more efficient and streamlined experience.

#### Shared Preferences:
The shared preferences mechanism ensures that user preferences or app states are stored persistently. This means that the app remembers whether it’s the user’s first time opening the app and ensures that the introduction screen is only shown once.

This feature enhances user experience by providing a smooth and intuitive flow, reducing unnecessary interactions for users who are already familiar with the app.

### Key Benefits:
- Seamless transition from the landing page to the home page for first-time and returning users.
- Personalized experience based on user interactions with shared preferences.
- Improves user engagement by offering a simple, non-intrusive introduction.
